# The Problem

***Employee turnover refers to the number or percentage of workers who leave an organization and are replaced by new employees.*** 

According to the Center of American Progress it costs about $10,000 to replace a working earning $50,000 per year, i.e 20% of their income.

Replacing a high-level employee can cost multiple of that.

 ● Cost of off-boarding 
 
 ● Cost of hiring (advertising, interviewing, hiring) 
 
 ● Cost of onboarding a new person (training, management time) 
 
 ● Lost productivity (a new person may take 1-2 years to reach the    productivity of an existing person) 

## Objective
  
Measuring employee turnover can be helpful to employers that want to examine reasons for turnover or estimate the cost-to-hire for budgeting purposes. 
My goal is to build a model which can predict whether an employee leaves or not and determine the factors which affect his decision making


## OSEMN Pipeline

_I’ll be following a typical data science pipeline, which is call “OSEMN” (pronounced awesome)._

1.  **O**btaining the data is the first approach in solving the problem. Here the dataset is from Kaggle.
    
2.  **S**crubbing or cleaning the data is the next step. Here we check for missing values, combine columns and more.
    
3.  **E**xploring the data will follow right after and allow further insight of what our dataset contains. 
    
4.  **M**odeling the data will tell us whether an employee will leave or not.
    
5.  I**N**terpreting the data is last. What are the features which influence whether an employee will leave or not?
